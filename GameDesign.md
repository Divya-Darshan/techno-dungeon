# 1. Overview and Vision

- **Game Title & Tagline**: ``not named yet & Death is not gonna be the end.`` <!--[Cause the quit btn is 😂👍]-->

- **High-level Summary**: ``game prototype set in a techno-medieval dungeon, featuring 2D sprite characters inside a PS1-style 3D world, focused on atmosphere, simple mechanics, and repeatable gameplay loops.``

- **Design Pillars**: ``Simple, atmospheric, mobile-friendly dungeon experience built around learning through repetition and light player choice.``

- **Target Audience**: ``Casual mobile users/Hardcore gamers/Mature Kid, others: idk😅👍`` 

# 2. Gameplay Core

- **Core Gameplay Loop:**  
  Explore dungeon -> die horribly -> respawn -> maybe survive this time → rinse and repeat. Learning is the real loot here.  

- **Primary Mechanics:**  
  Move around, dodge stuff, maybe fight a little(cause I'm bad with animation😩🤌), poke things, push buttons, look cool in your 2D sprite outfit.

- **Secondary Systems:**  
  Pick some upgrades, choose a path, touch some futuristic gadgets, maybe even press a hologram button (or fail spectacularly).

- **Progression Systems:**  
  You level up in **knowledge**, not stats. Dungeon = brain gym.

- **Fun Fact/Data:**  
  68% of indie devs (GDC said it) **actually use flowcharts** before coding. So if this goes sideways, blame the flowchart.

# 3. Narrative and Characters

- **Worldbuilding:**  
  A cursed dungeon that is basically **medieval on the outside, Star Wars on the inside**. Holograms, weird tech, and very dumb traditions all in one place.

- **Plot Outline:**  
  You are stuck. You die. You respawn. You try again. The dungeon doesn’t care. Repeat. It’s kinda sad, kinda hilarious.

- **Character Bios:**  
  Mostly you, the protagonist. And some mysterious NPCs who may or may not be helpful. Or evil. Or both.  

- **Narrative Mechanics:**  
  Story happens through the environment, little interactions, and repeated runs. Dialogue? Optional. Drama? Mandatory.

- **Personal Note:**  
  First team project lesson: don’t skip narrative mechanics. Otherwise, **UI redesign hell** incoming.

---

# 4. Art and Aesthetics

- **Visual Style Guide:**  
  2D sprite characters in a **low-poly 3D PS1-style world**. Retro, crunchy, and pixel-y in all the right ways.

- **Mood Boards:**  
  Dark, eerie, mysterious… but still funny at times. Futuristic-meets-medieval mashup.

- **Accessibility Considerations:**  
  Clear shapes, high contrast, readable fonts. Don’t make people squint while dying for the 10th time.

---

# 5. Audio Design

- **Music Style:**  
  Ambient, minimal, spooky. `Steal it from other game if you have to 😂`  

- **Sound Effects:**  
  Footsteps, UI clicks, light combat noises, gadget beeps. Basically, enough to make it feel alive but not explode your ears.

- **Voice Acting:**    None. Broke. Sorry 😅

---

# 6. User Experience and UI

- **HUD Layouts:**  
  Minimal. Only what you need to survive. Health, maybe a map, that’s it.

- **Menu Flowcharts:**  
  Easy to navigate, finger-friendly, mobile-ready. No maze of buttons.

- **Accessibility:**  
  Adjustable text size, simple control layout, all the good stuff.

- **Example:**  
  Dead Space put health bars on the suit. We like that idea. Maybe copy it. Maybe not. Who knows.

---

# 7. Technical and Tools

- **Target Platforms:**  
  Android (`mobile`) & desktop (`Windows/Linux`).

- **Engine Choice:**  
  Godot -> it’s free, it’s awesome, ```It won’t fry my PC```

- **Version Control:**  
  GitHub. You can blame commits later if it breaks.

---

# 8. Project Planning

- **Timeline with Milestones:**  
  Pre-production -> Production -> Testing -> Launch. (Easy to remember, right?)

- **Risk Management:**  
  Over-scoping, mobile performance limits, animation headaches. Basically, reality. (I should stop using my brain🤓🧠)  <!-- I hpe not to use that -->

- **Task Assignments:**  
  Solo project. I’m doing everything  <!-- dont fuck up any thing😅👍 --> . Pray for me. <!-- no one gonna save🥲 you! -->

# 9. Game Design Document - Mechanics

**Stages of Game Design:**

1. **Ideation:** Brainstorm and scribble nonsense.  
2. **Conceptualization:** Decide what actually matters.  
3. **Pre-production:** Write this GDD and maybe make a prototype.  
4. **Production:** Make it real.  
5. **Testing:** Die a lot, fix bugs, survive.  
6. **Launch:** Put it on the store. Hope for the best.  
7. **Post-launch:** Patch, update, DLC, rinse, repeat. <!-- 🥲😥 -->


> This document is a living GDD and will change as the project evolves. [`` Good luck to you 🫵 ``]

# WHAT WE GONNA DO?
I'm wanna make what's in my mind to reality but I don't know how 😂🥲.

[ 25/2/26 ] - I just combine this idea with one of the scenes which I got in my mind That was batman man, In the movie Dark Knight he got stuck in a pit Wish I can assume that it is gonna be the dungeon And the protagonist tries to climb out
