### *Death is not the end.*

**Techno-Dungeon** is a small, weird dungeon game planned for **2026**, mixing **medieval vibes** with **glitchy future tech**.  
Built in **Godot**, it’s **mobile-first** (desktop later), and designed around **short runs**, **dying a lot**, **learning the dungeon**, and slowly feeling **smarter than the place trying to kill you**.

You won’t win by grinding stats.  
You win by understanding the dungeon.
